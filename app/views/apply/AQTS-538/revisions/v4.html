		<p class="govuk-body">
			Qualified teacher status is a legal requirement to teach in many schools in England. It is a status that most schools prefer their teachers to have.

		<p class="govuk-body">
			It does not guarantee you a job or give you the right to work in England.
			 You'll still need to apply for a teaching job separately and have the correct visa or status.

			How to apply for QTS
		</h2>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
			<li>Use this service to check if you’re eligible to apply for QTS.</li>
			<li>If you’re eligible, you’ll be able to submit an application.</li>
			<li>Each application will be assessed by a trained assessor.</li>  
			<li>They will check all the information submitted.</li>
			<li>Some information may need verification by third parties.</li>
			<li>Once the assessment and all verifications have been completed, you’ll be told if you have been awarded QTS.</li>
		</ul>
				
		<p class="govuk-body"> 
			Your teaching qualifications and experience will be assessed against strict requirements. These requirements are mandatory and must be met in full. The process is designed to ensure we only award QTS to the highest quality teachers. This means it can take time.
		</p>

		<p class="govuk-body"> 
			We assess 90 per cent of applications within 12 months.
		</p>

		<p>
			Information correct as of July 2024. Timelines are based on total applications completed since February 2023.
		</p>

		<p>
			It may take longer if we need to ask for further information or if external factors, or third parties, cause delays. This includes waiting for references, or verification of qualifications or professional standing. The time it takes to assess applications is regularly reviewed and subject to change.
		</p>

		<p>
			The DfE does not charge for assessing your application or awarding QTS.
