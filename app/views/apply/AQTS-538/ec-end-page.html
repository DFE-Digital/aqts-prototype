		<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">You're eligible to apply for qualified teacher status (QTS)</h1>
		
		<p>
			Based on the information you’ve given us you can apply for QTS.
		
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparing to apply</h2>
		
		<p>If you decide to apply, you’ll need to provide a range of evidence. We’ll ask you to upload some scans, photos, or
			original files.</p>
		<div class="govuk-inset-text">
			<p>You’ll need to complete your application within 6 months of starting it. You can start straight away, or you can
				spend some time gathering the documents you need first.</p>
		
			<p>Once you begin, we’ll sign you out if you’re inactive for 60 minutes.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Application timelines</h2>
		
		<p>
			Your teaching qualifications and experience will be assessed against strict requirements. These requirements are
			mandatory and must be met in full. The process is designed to ensure we only award QTS to the highest quality
			teachers. This means it can take time.</p>
		
		<p>
			We assess 90 per cent of applications within 12 months.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Information correct as of July 2024. Timelines are based on total applications completed since February 2023.
		</p>

		<p>
			It may take longer if we need to ask for further information or if external factors, or third parties, cause delays.
			This includes waiting for references, or verification of qualifications or professional standing. The time it takes to
			assess applications is regularly reviewed and subject to change.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we'll ask for</h2>

					There are 4 ways to prove your English language ability.
				</p>

		
				<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Born in or have citizenship of an exempt country</h3>
				<p>
					If you were born in or hold citizenship of any of these listed countries, you’re exempt from English language requirements:
				</p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" style="column-count:2">
				<li>Antigua and Barbuda</li>
				<li>Australia</li>
				<li>The Bahamas</li>
				<li>Barbados</li>
				<li>Belize</li>
				<li>Canada</li>
				<li>Dominica</li>
				<li>Grenada</li>
				<li>Guyana</li>
				<li>Ireland</li>
				<li>Jamaica</li>
				<li>Malta</li>
				<li>New Zealand</li>
				<li>St Kitts and Nevis</li>
				<li>St Lucia</li>
				<li>St Vincent and the Grenadines</li>
				<li>Trinidad and Tobago</li>
				<li>USA</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Qualified teachers from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey are also exempt.
				</p>

				<p>
					You’ll need to provide your passport or official identification documents for that country as proof.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you’re not exempt by birth or citizenship, you must be able to provide evidence of your English language ability in one of the following ways:
				</p>

				<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. If you studied in an exempt country</h3>

				<p>
					Upload the transcript from your teaching qualification or university degree (which you can request from the institution where you studied). Check the exempt countries listed in ‘Born in or have citizenship of an exempt country’.
				</p>

				<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. If you studied in a country that’s NOT exempt</h3>

				<p>
					If your teaching qualification or university degree was taught exclusively in the English language you can upload an official document, which is sometimes called a Medium of Instruction (MOI).
				</p>

				<p>
					You can request this from the institution where you studied. It must be signed and stamped by them on official headed paper and it must state that the medium of instruction was English. It must also include your name, degree title and award date.
				</p>

				<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">4. Provide an approved English language certificate</h3>

				<p>
					If you cannot provide one of the documents described in 1,2 or 3, you'll need a <a href="///">B2 level (opens in new tab)</a> Secure English Language Test (SELT) from on approved provider. We accept the following approved providers and tests:
				</p>

				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

				</ul>

				<p>
					The test must be awarded within the last 2 years before the date of your application.
